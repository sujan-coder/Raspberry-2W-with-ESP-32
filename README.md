# Raspberry Pi 2W â†” ESP32 Communication Projects

This repository contains small projects demonstrating communication between Raspberry Pi 2W and ESP32 using various protocols like UART and I2C.

## Goals
- Send and receive data between RPi and ESP32
- Display messages on OLED via ESP32
- Control LEDs from RPi through ESP32
- Explore other ideas like sensor data relay, camera integration, etc.

## Protocols Used
- UART
- I2C (coming soon)
- SPI (planned)
